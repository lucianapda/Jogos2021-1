# Horror stories played by: The Horror German Dude's Game Script

When a new playthrough is started the player is greeted with ambient music and a text
fading in.

>Dear Mr Hans, if you are reading this there are no hopes for me now, I might be already dead or too far gone with my sanity to be recognized as myself. I know it is a lot to ask, and for sure it will be a great weight for you to carry, but I cannot trust anyone but you with this.
>
>Please, come to **[[PLACE NAME]]**, I can't save myself, but you may be able to save us all from that.
>
>Att.
>
>**[[PIONEER]]**

Following this, the text will describe the ambient where Hans starts, this may change each time, but will follow the structure down:

>You're in a cold room, with stone walls, the fireplace show no signs of being used in years. You see a table with a note, an armchair, and the fireplace. You can also see a door and a staircase leading up.

The player might interact with the listed items, they'll have longer, more detailed, explanations:

>The wooden table sits in the center of the room, it would have being used to put drinks in reading sessions.

The player may as well chose to go through the passages, entering other ambients. Eventually in this other ambients, the passage will be blocked, indicating the need of a tool or item. This might be as simples as stating that a door is locked, meaning the player might need a key, or the passage might have bem blocked with bricks and cement, meaning the player will need a sledgehammer.

In some ambients, the player will find items, that will be useful to open passages, he may find also notes, these notes will be one of two generated texts, either it will be a letter of the dead pioneer, indicating what is happening, or a hint indicating where an useful item is.

These hints will take narrative form as, in the voice of the pioneer, the player will be instructed to put the item in a specific place.

The story driving notes, in the other hand, will be chunks of a bigger text, that will describe what happened in the place. Something in the lines:

>Day 1: As I went back to **[[PLACE NAME]]**, I carried with me the **[[TRIGGER ITEM]]**, it looks oddly mysterious as no one could translate its writings.

>Day 2: I've worked many days and many nights into decrypting the messages on the **[[TRIGGER ITEM]]**, it seems like instructions to some kind of ritual or something.

...

>Day 7: What was once done, cannot be undone, I've doomed myself by **[[AWAKENING || OPENINING THE PORTAL TO || CALLING]]** **[[MONSTER NAME]]**

These notes will not be necessarily found in a specific order.

The map will be structured in a way that there's an order in wich the player will get to access new ambients. This is done by either putting the new passage inside the ambient, or the item. In this sense, there is a final room, in witch de dead body of  the pioneer will be found as well as the last note piece.
