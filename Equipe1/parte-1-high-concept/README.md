The demographic for this game would be people that like horror stories, that also expect to interact with the story, not being distract by graphics, focusing solely on the story.

## Competion

Most text based advetures have a fixed storyline, ours differentiate by having procedural generated stories.

A few games that also have a procedural generated stories, but their theme's are more funny, or not so story driven, such as [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/).

There's also [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io) that uses [Open AP GPT-3 API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to generate the story based on user inputs, but results are not entirely effective, as the AI can have a different understanding

## Unique Selling Point

High replayability, as the game isn't drive by mechanics, but story, as by each playthrough have different story.

## Target Hardware

Low-processing power desktop computers, even without a windows-like graphic interface.

## Design Goals

Simple: Exploring each story ambient is made easy by giving the player every possible movement that he can do in each scene.

Short Stories: Each stories have a defined end that can be reached in a relative short period, but with meaningful content that trigger emonotial responses in the player, like H.P. Lovecraft stories.

## Characters

Protagonist: The playable character that follows in the footsteps of the co-protagonist, exploring the clues left behind, trying to re-trace these steps.

Co-Protagonist: A character that already went through the story, changing the story world by their actions, leaving clues behind and changing the story ambient.
